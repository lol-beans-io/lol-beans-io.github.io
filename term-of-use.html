<h2>About Slope Game Subscriber-only Content</h2><p>Subscriptions may be available to access Slope Game subscriber-only content. If you are under 18 years of age, please have your parent or guardian register, complete the purchase and agree to these Terms of Use on your behalf. In such instances “you” means you and your parent or guardian. The information you provide for registration is necessary to confirm your identity when you visit the site and to process your payment(s). We will use your information in accordance with our privacy policy.

 While Slope Game believes and intends that its information security practices reflect good practice, there is no such thing as perfect information security. As such, you assume the risk of security breaches and all consequences resulting from them. You must safeguard your login credentials and not share them with any other person. Only one individual may access the subscriber-only content at the same time using the same user name or password.

 By subscribing to use the subscriber-only content, you agree to pay the associated fees. SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR SUBSCRIBER-ONLY CONTENT ARE AUTO-RENEWING. THIS MEANS THAT WE WILL BILL THE CREDIT CARD THAT YOU PROVIDE TO US UPON YOUR INITIAL PURCHASE OR AT THE END OF YOUR FREE TRIAL (IF APPLICABLE) AND ON A RECURRING BASIS AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH RENEWAL PERIOD. BY SIGNING UP FOR THE SERVICE, YOU AUTHORIZE RECURRING CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD. You agree that Slope Game will not be responsible for any expenses that you may incur resulting from overdrawing your bank account or exceeding your credit limit as a result of an automatic charge made under this agreement.

 You agree to keep your account and payment information current at all times. To make changes to your payment or account information, please contact us at <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b6c5c3d4c5d5c4dfc6c2dfd9d8c5f6d5d9d9dadbd7c2de98d5d9db">[email&#160;protected]</a>. Please also let us know immediately if you suspect any unauthorized use of your credit card or login credentials. 

 Please note that we use a third party not affiliated with us to process payments for the subscriber-only content. You agree that the third party processor is solely responsible for controlling, handling, processing, or fulfilling purchases processed through its systems. You may be subject to additional terms of use and/or privacy policies of the third party processor when you purchase subscriber-only content.

 Should you wish to cancel your subscription, please let us know in advance of your renewal date by contacting us at <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3e4d4b5c4d5d4c574e4a5751504d7e5d515152535f4a56105d5153">[email&#160;protected]</a>. Annual subscribers may cancel their subscription within thirty (30) days of being charged and receive a refund. For all other subscribers, you must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of subscription fees for the renewal term to your credit card. We reserve the right to issue refunds at our sole discretion. If we provide a refund, we are not obligated to do so again in the future. We may cancel your subscription at any time. If we cancel your subscription for a reason other than for cause (cause being, for example, your breach of these Terms of Use), we will issue you a refund for your unused portion of your subscription.

 Rates for subscriber-only content are subject to change. The then-current rate will be charged upon auto-renewal. Contact us at <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="661513041505140f16120f090815260509090a0b07120e4805090b">[email&#160;protected]</a> should you wish to cancel your subscription after a rate increase for a refund.

 From time to time we may offer free trials to, or introductory pricing for, the subscriber-only content. These offers are available to you only if you have not previously been a subscriber to subscriber-only content. If you respond to a free trial or introductory pricing offer but do not qualify, we reserve the right to reject your order. </p></div> </div> <div class="block-footer mt-20"><div class="container-fluid"><div class="d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center"><div class="footer-content"><a href="about-us.html">About Us </a><a href="contact-us.html">Contact Us </a><a href="copyright-infringement-notice-procedure.html">Copyright infringement notice procedure </a><a href="term-of-use.html">Term of use </a><a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy </a></div></div> <div style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:10px">This website is contributed by game enthusiasts.
